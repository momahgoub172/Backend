# Project: Short Polling

## Description
- This project showcases a Web API server that utilizes short polling to provide near-real-time updates to clients. 
- Short polling is a communication design pattern in which clients regularly send requests to check for updates, allowing the server to provide immediate updates when new data becomes available.
